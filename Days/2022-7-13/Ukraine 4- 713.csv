"POINT (36.2301797 50.2659221)",1,Ukraine used artillery combined with helicopters to attack Kozacha Lopan, Tsupivka, and Velyki Prokhody. Russians tried to attack Dementiivka and were repelled (1).
"POINT (36.2758417 50.2404577)",2,Russians claim they destroyed a Ukrainian recon element that pushed out of Dementiivka (2). They claim to have killed 5 and captured 10.
"POINT (37.154448 49.2656114)",3,The mystery Ivanivka: There are *so many* Ivanivkas. Today, there were reports that Russia shelled an Ivanivka and that Ukraine repelled an attack that came from the direction of an Ivanivka. I assumed it was the southern Ivanivka on this map (3).

Then, later in the day, I got confirmation from a Russian source that the more northern Ivanivka (blue arrow) was heavily shelled by Ukrainian forces (which would make sense if Russia was attacking from there).

Note that this northern Ivanivka has the "fortified town" marker. This is a built up base the Russians have been using for a while now. Also note that there are Ukrainian forces just west (Mospanove and Yavirske) that appear to have been static for weeks now. They aren't static.

If I piece together the information from Russian sources and Ukrainian sources, it makes me wonder if Ukraine is getting close to attacking this northern Ivanivka? As opposed to the more southern one? Or perhaps both?! Why are there so many Ivanivkas?!

"POINT (37.3980239 49.0201599)",4,I saw no comments on the Russian offensive actions out of Mazanivka and towards Krasnopillya or Bohorodychne today, but I assume they proceeded as per usual: lots of casualties and no success.

Which is what happened when they attacked Dolyna (4). Note that Ukrainian artillery is pounding Brazhkivka and Sulyhivka (5). Also note that I think Ukraine may have captured Dibrovne but I cannot find confirmation.
