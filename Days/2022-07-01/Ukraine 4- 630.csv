The second came from the Kochubeivka direction (1) and occurred later in the day. The second attack was weaker than the first.

I have decided to map the refinery conservatively, which is to say that Ukraine still controls a corner of the facility. My gut tells me Ukraine has lost this area completely, I am just staying conservative here.
"POINT (38.3375547 48.8374678)",They are pushing towards the train tracks north of Maloryazantseve (10), they captured Topolivka (11), and they probably captured the Oil Refinery (12).

"POINT (38.3182967 48.7831524)",13,Russia is pushing towards the T1302 highway from Mykolaivka (13) and near Yakovlivka (14), both attacks have thus far failed.

"POINT (38.1745634 48.6515081)",15,Russia Mercenaries are trying to capture Pokrovske, but their attacks are being repelled with significant casualties (15). The mercenaries are also trying to push through the northern part of Klynove (16), but the area has a complex system of trenchlines that have bogged down the Russian mercenaries. This defensive line from Klynove up towards Pokrovske will be vitally important for the Ukrainian defense over the coming weeks and months.

"POINT (38.2551168 48.5024192)",17,Russian forces are trying to attack the Vuhlehirska power plant from both Myronivka (17) and Novoluhanske (18), but they are struggling to make ground and taking heavy casualties. 
"POINT (38.1536272 48.4299087)",18,Russian forces are trying to attack the Vuhlehirska power plant from both Myronivka (17) and Novoluhanske (18), but they are struggling to make ground and taking heavy casualties. 
"POINT (38.1062867 48.4574071)",19,There is heavy ongoing fighting around Kodema (19), which I believe is still contested.
"POINT (37.2196324 47.7311293)",20,There is ongoing fighting around Pavlivka (20). The news coming out of this area is vague at best from Ukrainian sources, and overly confident from the Russians. The reality is likely that the town is contested, which is how I have mapped it.
"POINT (32.79293 47.1160686)",22,Ukraine is attacking Snihurivka (22) with unknown results. 
"POINT (32.3754541 46.7937608)",23,Ukraine is attacking Kyselivka (23) and Pravdyne (24). Some sources claim Ukraine has captured both of these areas, but I think it is more likely both are contested. 
"POINT (36.7820105 50.128569)",A,Other than this, the sitation around Kharkiv is more or less status quo. There is heavy shelling, especially closer to the river near Verknii Saltiv (A) and Staryi Saltiv (B). Verknii Saltiv was hit by air strikes today.

"POINT (36.0482998 50.3931071)",C,Russia will likely try to capture Udy (C) in the near future. They have attacked it in the recent past, and there are ongoing skirmishes. Russia seems intent on capturing this town, since it is so close to the border.
"POINT (36.9481752 49.2949759)",D,Today Russian propagandists claimed to have stopped a Ukrainian advance across the river in Zalyman (D). Russia had attacking Zalyman several times over the past few days, and each attack was repelled by Ukrainian defenders. This story is likely an attempt to save face due to these consistent failures. However, the video evidence they posted to support their claim came from when Ukraine tried to attack towards Izyum on May 15-16 (E).

"POINT (38.1548023 48.4733342)",G,I still do not know who control Semyhirya (G), which makes me believe it is likely Russia. I have it listed under Ukrainian control due to the lack of confirmation.
"POINT (36.6117257 47.7025884)",H,Today Ukraine stated that Russia was firing artillery near Novoukrainske (H). This position is very close to known Russian controlled areas. Recently I have heard that Ukraine had attacked Stepove, but not with the intent on capturing the town but rather destroy Russian equipment. Perhaps Ukraine is getting close to the town again? Perhaps they have captured it? I do not know.
"POINT (36.082131 47.5047437)",I,The Polohy area: Yesterday Ukraine stated Russia fired artillery at them near Inzhenerne (I). This implies that Ukraine may have captured Novokarlivka some time during the past week. Ukraine announced the capture of Bilohirya in the same sort of manner on June 24th, five days prior.
"POINT (32.1130732 46.6197391)",25,Ukraine is attacking Stanislav (25), with unknown results.
