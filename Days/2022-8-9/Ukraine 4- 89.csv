If you listen to the Russian military, they destroyed the airport in an unfortunate accident. So, if you believe their story, this damage was caused by their total incompetence and inability to form a professional military force.

The Ukrainian military claims this airbase was destroyed by Ukrainian-made weapons. That seems far-fetched but possible. 

Russian propagandists blame sabotage.

The internet and western observers believe Ukraine used ATACMS ( Army Tactical Missile System), long-range missiles fired by HIMARS of M270 MLRS. They have a range of around 300km.
