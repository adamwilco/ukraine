"Residents of Berdyansk reported (https://t.me/brdnews/13066) a loud "clap" in local Telegram chats around 2:20 p.m. on June 20. Both the sound and the blast wave were best felt in the western micro-districts of AKZ/RTS and the village of Azovske, from where the plume of gray smoke rose.

⚓️ The "Berdyan Partisan Army" channel published (https://t.me/brdprotiv/929) a photo, thanks to which it is possible to establish the approximate location of the "arrival".

Most likely, the blow fell on an "island" with outbuildings in the middle of a field and an orchard of the "Voinikov and Co" farm, near the Berdyansk airport.

According to Berdyan residents, it was in that area that the Russians placed their electronic warfare station.

In addition, it is known that the territory of the "Prylyv" plant, whose buildings were in the frame with "cotton", has long been used by the occupiers as a military base. S-300 air defense systems regularly left from here to attack Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk region

Currently, there is no official information from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine about the destruction of targets in Berdyansk. Propaganda resources of the occupation administration of the city ignored the explosion."
