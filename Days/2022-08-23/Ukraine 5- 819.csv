"POINT (37.6861898 48.0553662)",20,Russians are still trying to capture Pisky (20). A Ukrainian claims that Ukraine controls the town “situationally” and “conditionally.” I am under the impression that Ukrainian officers believe they could retake Pisky if given the necessary resources (heavy weapons). However, I do not think they will get what they need. I believe Ukraine is saving these resources for a potential offensive. In the meantime, Russia is struggling to take control of the town, and they have tried bypassing it to attack Pervomaiske.

There is ongoing fighting. Russia has expended great resources crushing the Ukrainian bridgehead across the Inhulets, and it seems the bridgehead could be crumbling.

"POINT (36.3011992 47.578552)",B,Russia is heavily shelling the Zaporizhzhia area, and the Ukrainian counter-battery fire is slowly destroying Russian artillery systems. There was quite a lot of artillery fire around the towns of Dorozhnyanka and Kostyantynivka (B). Ukraine has been trying to capture these two towns for a few weeks. I did not see any news of a Ukrainian attack in this area, but the concentration of artillery fire makes me believe they probably did.
