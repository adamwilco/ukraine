Given the news of the general Russian withdrawal from Izyum and redeployment to Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, it is possible these attacks are designed to keep the Ukrainians pinned in place while the Russians withdraw from other areas. 

Ukraine probably captured Sulyhivka, but I have not seen confirmation. 

The area around Bohorodychne is quiet, and the rumors that Ukraine captured Pasika could be true although I am remaining conservative on my map. I have expanded the gray zone around Bohorodychne to express my uncertainty. I may expand the gray zone further in future days. This whole area of the map could end up changing rapidly over a short period of time.
