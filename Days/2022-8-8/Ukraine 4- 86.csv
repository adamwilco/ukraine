"POINT (37.4684512 49.035057)",1,The situation appears to be more or less unchanged from the prior few days, although this could be due to a media blackout. Russia tried to attack Bohorodychne several times today, but were repelled in the western outskirts each time (1).
"POINT (38.2987714 48.8538023)",2,The Siversk area has been relatively quiet recently. Russia still has not fully captured the Luhansk Oblast, and they spent the day firing 11 artillery barrages into Ukrainian positions followed by a small assault bolstered by helicopters for air support (2). They failed to push Ukrainian defenders out of their positions.
"POINT (38.1841149 48.6756283)",3,The Bakhmut area has a lot of heavy fighting. Russian forces are attacking Yakovlivka (3), Soledar (4, and Bakhmutske (5). Fighting is ongoing.

"POINT (38.1210566 48.5656955)",7,Russia is trying very hard to attack Vershyna (7,8) and Kodema (9,10) and are attacking both from several angles. Ukrainian defenders are holding on.

"POINT (38.0674386 48.4245313)",11,There was a somewhat ambiguous statement regarding Russia attacking Zaitseve from the direction of Kodema, the issue is that there are two Zaitseve. I guessed the one to the south of Kodema might make more sense (11), although I’m really not sure if this is the correct one. BTW the yellow blotch is a minefield.
"POINT (37.8126875 48.2110631)",12,The Donetsk area: Russia is, for the most part, attacking all of the same areas as they have been for a few days now. The main purpose of these attacks is to surround Avdiivka and force Ukraine to abandon the area the same way they were forced to abandon Lysychansk. Russia has accepted they cannot take the town by fighting it directly.
 
Russia is attacking Krasnohorivka (12). A few days ago they jumped across the highway north of Krasnohorivka and settled into the area around the train tracks, but since then the news all seems to very explicitly indicate they are attacking Krasnohorivka from the east, and not from this position near the train tracks which is to the north. I find this weird. 

"POINT (37.7713556 48.0834505)",13,Russian forces are attacking north towards Avdiivka (13) with little success. 
"POINT (37.7249889 48.0646218)",14,Russians are attacking Pisky (14) and they claim to have simultaneously completely captured the town AND to have failed to capture any additional ground from a few days ago when they claimed to have captured half the town. Logic. 
"POINT (37.6694832 48.003184)",15,Russian forces are attacking north from Lozove towards Nevelske (15), this is the only new attack vector, and it made no progress. 
"POINT (37.5778132 47.9086822)",16,Russian forces are trying to capture the farmland around Marinka (16), which is basically all flat ground that is in direct line of sight of Ukraine’s higher ground. Which seems like a pretty bad place to attack.

"POINT (32.6178183 47.0352928)",22,In the Kherson/Mykolaiv area Russia has added a very large amount of forces, I have heard there are around 28 BTGs. Russia picked the best performing units from all around the war and placed them here to continue an offensive. Where that offensive may lead is a bit up in the air. They could go north towards Kryvyi Rih, or west towards Mykolaiv. Well, today Russia launched an attack on Blahodatne (22). The attack began with a large artillery barrage followed by a ground assault, likely supported by air power. Russia’s goal here is to capture Blahodatne and then go north towards Partyzansk and take the main highway that leads directly to Mykolaiv. However, both Blahodatne and especially Partyzansk are HEAVILY fortified. This attack will be very difficult for Russia. 
"POINT (33.3768668 46.7212044)",23,Today, in Nova Kakhovka, Vitaly Gura, a Russian collaborator who was named the “deputy chairman of the administration” was assassinated (23). From the images, it looks like he was gunned down in the doorway/foyer of his home. He was rushed to the hospital (in Crimea???) but died in the car.
