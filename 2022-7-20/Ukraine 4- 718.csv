"POINT (36.2314747 50.2328017)",1,Today Ukraine announced a successful operation in Dementiivka where they destroyed a platoon of Russian marine special forces (1). It is unclear who controls the town, or when this attack happened.
"POINT (37.1601718 49.0747041)",2,Ukraine repelled an attack towards Dmytrivka (2), but it is unclear which angle the attack came from. It could have from from the north, as depicted, or possibly from the east.
"POINT (37.2029155 49.0735796)",3,It is possible that Ukraine defended an attack against Brazhkivka today (3). You could also read the report that the attack came from Brazhkivka, which would mean the town is under Russian control. I await clarification, but tentatively label Brazhkivka as Ukrainian.
"POINT (37.2506375 48.9680987)",4,Some time over the last few days, Ukraine captured Dibrovne (4) and perhaps even Brazhkivka.

"POINT (38.2252996 48.9296009)",6,Russian forces are trying to push towards Hryhorivka (6) and Serebrianka (7) but they are having a lot of trouble moving through the terrain. With regards to Hryhorivka, the town is almost shaped like a bowl surrounded by wooded areas. Ukrainians control the high ground on roughly 3/4 of the town, and are also using the wooded areas for defense. With respect to Serebrianka, Russia has just about fought their way up a hill, after which they have to move down the other side and then up and over another hill to reach the town. Ukraine is using this second hill as a great natural defensive position.

"POINT (38.2721621 48.8822102)",8,Russia needs to capture Verkhnokamyanske in order to attack Siversk, but Verkhnokamyanske is an easy to defend because it is a valley between two hills that are under Ukrainian control. Russia is trying to push into the town, (8,9), but they are having a lot of trouble controlling the high ground. Their most successful attacks into the town have been countered by huge Ukrainian artillery barrages that drove Russian forces out and back into the bushes.

"POINT (38.2652802 48.8053732)",10,Russia seems convinced they will have a breakthrough somewhere between Berestove and Ivano-Darivka, or perhaps even Bilohorivka. Of these three areas, Russia is pushing the hardest into Ivano-Darivka (10), with smaller attacks into Berestove (11) and Bilohorivka (12). The attacks into Berestove and Bilohorivka, in my opinion, cannot be successful unless Russia is capable of combining air and grounds in a coordinated attack. Which is something the Russian army seems incapable of doing. The terrain just favors the defenders too much to take these areas with ground forces alone without horrific casualties. And let's be honest, they have already suffered horrifica casualties after many weeks of failed assaults. Russia began attacking this area around May 20th, nearly 60 days ago.

"POINT (38.2519118 48.4732037)",13,Even though Russian forces are low on infantry, they are trying to storm the Vuhlehirska power plant (13), Novoulhanske (14), and Semyhirya (15). Just because Russia is low on infantry doesn't mean the situation is great for Ukraine, because they are suffering attrition from constant artillery fire.

"POINT (37.8201298 48.1921934)",16,Capturing Kamyanka is extremely important for Russia because it brings them one step closer to taking Avdiivka which, believe it or not, is one of their primary objectives in this war. Several weeks ago Russia was making semi-successful assaults on Kamyanka, but all of the infantry and a large fraction of their artillery were pulled out to attack the Popasna/Lysychansk area (where they suffered terrible casualties). Now, without replacing any of the forces sent north, Russia is continuing their assault on Kamyanka (16). The Russian forces have terrible morale, and the attacks are half hearted at best.
