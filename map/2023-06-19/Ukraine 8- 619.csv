Scouts have calculated the new location of the occupation troops in the village of Lazurne.

Before the war, it was one of the most popular Ukrainian resorts.

At the end of May, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed the BTGr in the "Chaika" boarding house. Its remains moved to separate wooden houses (about 70) of the "Sonyachny" and "Zoloty Bereg" boarding houses.

Those involved inform.

üí¨ "Not all the occupiers saw the dawn of 06/18/2023, but those who did, Nihua was not happy...
After many explosions (up to 30 hits!), all the houses were blown down by the holy air of God, which is Japanese - "kamikaze". The wooden houses caught fire beautifully together with the sleepy gunnery, the detonation of the gunnery, panic and screams - everything is as it should be!!! Immediately it became known about 40+ blindfolded pig dogs. Closer to noon, another 18 blind people and 19 still alive incompletes were brought to the Skadovsk hospital. By evening, there were already 60+ zhmuropackets (and some say up to 80), and 80+ wounded orcs for sure.
There has never been such a good morning in Lazurny!! Congratulations to Boivoy HerSonky üçâüçâüçâ Watermelons!!!
REVENGE every day!!!"


"At the end of May, the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian SSR disarmed the battalion's tactical group in the "Chaika" boarding house in Lazurny. The remnants of the surviving Russian army commanders were moved to separate wooden houses (approximately 70 houses), the nearby boarding house "Golden Coast", which was already full of Russian tourists. They hid as far as 500 m from the first puss. Not for long.
Not everyone saw the dawn on June 18, 2023, and those who saw it were not happy at all.
After several explosions, all the houses were blown away by the holy wind, kamikaze in Japanese.
The wooden houses were burning beautifully together with the sleepy Rusna, plus the detonation of the gunnery, panic, screams - everything is as it should be. Immediately it became known about 40+ blindfolded. Closer to noon, another 18 blind people and 19 still alive incompletes were brought to the Skadovsk hospital.
All the doctors were called to the hospitals, by the evening there were 60+ squints, some say up to 80, 80+ wounded for sure, mostly amputees. There has never been such a good morning in Lazurny!"
