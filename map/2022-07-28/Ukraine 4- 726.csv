"POINT (37.4342374 49.0924263)",2,Russia attack Bohorodychne and were repelled (1), but that isn't the interesting thing going on in the Izyum area. I want to first say that nothing going on in this area has been confirmed, the news is confusing, it could be part of an elaborate disinformation campaign, but there are multiple sources of information backing up the claims.

So, what are the claims? First, a Russian pontoon bridge across the Siverskyi Donets river has disappeared. There are rumors that people saw Russia removing this pontoon bridge. It is possible the bridge was destroyed. https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1551881753203179522?s=20&t=adauDm5BqzuSRSGbn7sSdA

Second, there are rumors that Russia is withdrawing from Bohorodychne (1), Studenok (A), Yatskivka (B), and Borova (C).

The disappearance of the pontoon bridge is really the piece of information that ties all of these rumors together. With the pontoon bridge gone, resupplying the Russian forces in this area becomes substantially more difficult. And with it gone, it makes sense for Russia to begin removing forces from here.

However, it may not be so simple, and things may not be as they appear.
