There are a lot of attacks going on from both Russian and Ukrainian forces (I have decided not to map many of the Ukrainian attacks out of an abundance of caution). For this reason, I have made much of the area gray area, because I am not sure who, if anyone, controls this area. Similarly, I am not sure where exactly some of the Russian attacks are coming from. For example, the attack on Hryhorivka, are the Russians moving along the river, or more inland? Does Ukraine control the river area? I am not sure. I have read that Russia controls the area along the river, which is how I have mapped it. But simultaneously, I have seen a lot of evidence that Ukraine controls the southern part of Bilohorivka, which I have left as a gray area on the map. There have been attacks towards Serebryanka, which obviously have to pass through this gray area as well, and also attacks towards Verkhnokamyanske. On top of all of this, Ukraine claims there are two towns in Luhanske that Russia has failed to capture. We know Bilohorivka is one, but which is the other? There are two options: Zolotarivka and Verkhnokamyanka. I have seen evidence of Ukrainian forces in Zolotarivka, so I have decided to map this town as contested. It could be the other that is contested. Or maybe Ukraine is lying and neither are contested. 
 
Russians have not captured Bilohorivka, and they are heavily shelling the area with Grad MLRS and s300 anti-aircraft missiles (A). Russians tried to attack Hryhorivka, but they were repelled (5). There is ongoing fighting in Verkhnokamyanske (6).

There have been attacks towards Serebryanka, which obviously have to pass through this gray area as well, and also attacks towards Verkhnokamyanske. On top of all of this, Ukraine claims there are two towns in Luhanske that Russia has failed to capture. We know Bilohorivka is one, but which is the other? There are two options: Zolotarivka and Verkhnokamyanka. I have seen evidence of Ukrainian forces in Zolotarivka, so I have decided to map this town as contested. It could be the other that is contested. Or maybe Ukraine is lying and neither are contested. 
 
Russians have not captured Bilohorivka, and they are heavily shelling the area with Grad MLRS and s300 anti-aircraft missiles (A). Russians tried to attack Hryhorivka, but they were repelled (5). There is ongoing fighting in Verkhnokamyanske (6).

"POINT (38.2257566 48.8387316)",7,There are rumors that Russia captured Ivano-Darivka (7), but I have seen no evidence to support it. I believe fighting is ongoing. Similarly, there are rumors that Russia has pushed through Spirne (8), but I have not seen contrary evidence that their attacks are being stifled.

"POINT (38.2575941 48.7364437)",10,Ukrainian forces have abandoned Berestove after roughly 59 days of fighting (9), which seems to be about the maximum extent Ukraine has been able to hold each of these small towns. After a while every single structure is destroyed and you run out of things to defend, at which point Ukraine decides to pull back to another town where the process starts anew. However, Russia still has not been able to capture the town (10) due to liberal application of Ukrainian artillery.

"POINT (38.1376047 48.6622293)",11,There is ongoing fighting in the outskirts of Soledar (11). 
"POINT (38.1799638 48.6425595)",12,There is heavy ongoing fighting around Pokrovske (12,13), and some of the lesser Russian sources are claiming the town is captured, although the better sources have not made any such claim. Similarly, Russia is pushing very hard to attack Vesela Dolyna (14) and Vershyna (15). And the lesser Russian sources claim they have been captured, while the better Russian sources have made no such claim. I have not seen evidence that Russia has even reached the towns yet and are still fighting in the outskirts. Russia very much wants to capture these three towns so they can begin attacking Bakhmut. Russia’s goal is to push Ukraine back to their Slovyansk/Kramatorsk/Kostyantynivka defensive line as fast as possible. Every day that passes, Ukraine gets stronger and Russia gets weaker.

"POINT (38.245107 48.4756315)",16,There is ongoing fighting around the Vuhlehirske power plant (16) and Novoluhanske (17) and while these positions are holding off for the moment, you could see them collapse in the near future due to what is going on north of them.

"POINT (37.7935485 48.1958953)",18,Russia isn’t having much luck attacking Kamyanka, so they decided to try a recon mission 2-3km north near Novoselivka Druha, but the recon failed and they were repulsed (18).

"POINT (37.5672676 47.8366456)",19,Russia tried to attack towards Novomykhailivka again today, and they were repelled (19).

"POINT (37.239444 47.7879061)",20,Yesterday I read that Ukraine had attacked out of Vuhledar towards Mykilske (20), but that the attack was destroyed. I could not find confirmation of this attack, and I found it unlikely such an attack would be destroyed so I didn’t mention it. Now, today, there is a report that Russia tried to attack Mykilske but were repelled (21). So, perhaps Ukraine did move into Mykilske yesterday. I will leave it marked as contested for now.
"POINT (38.2454392 48.9139393)",A,Mapping this area is difficult. There are a lot of attacks going on from both Russian and Ukrainian forces (I have decided not to map many of the Ukrainian attacks out of an abundance of caution). For this reason, I have made much of the area gray area, because I am not sure who, if anyone, controls this area. Similarly, I am not sure where exactly some of the Russian attacks are coming from. For example, the attack on Hryhorivka, are the Russians moving along the river, or more inland? Does Ukraine control the river area? I am not sure. I have read that Russia controls the area along the river, which is how I have mapped it. But simultaneously, I have seen a lot of evidence that Ukraine controls the southern part of Bilohorivka, which I have left as a gray area on the map. There have been attacks towards Serebryanka, which obviously have to pass through this gray area as well, and also attacks towards Verkhnokamyanske. On top of all of this, Ukraine claims there are two towns in Luhanske that Russia has failed to capture. We know Bilohorivka is one, but which is the other? There are two options: Zolotarivka and Verkhnokamyanka. I have seen evidence of Ukrainian forces in Zolotarivka, so I have decided to map this town as contested. It could be the other that is contested. Or maybe Ukraine is lying and neither are contested.
