"POINT (37.4431361 49.0249606)",1,There isn’t much news from the Izyum area. Russia launched a weak attack towards Bohorodychne, and it was repelled (1).
"POINT (38.3012174 48.8563678)",2,It appears both Russia and Ukraine have withdrawn forces from the Siversk area to deploy in other areas. Russia is pretending to take advantage of this by launching failed attacks towards Verkhnokamyanske (2). 

We say “towards” because Russia still hasn’t captured all of Luhansk oblast and has to fight through Ukrainian forces to even reach Verkhnokamyanske.

"POINT (38.1826827 48.7094142)",3,There is heavy fighting in the Bakhmut area. In the north, Russia tried to send recon around Yakovlivka, but they were located and destroyed (3).
"POINT (38.1813093 48.6831272)",4,There is heavy fighting in the Bakhmut area. In the north, Russia tried to send recon around Yakovlivka, but they were located and destroyed (3). They then sent an assault into the town, which failed (4).
"POINT (38.1350357 48.6571251)",5,Russia’s assault on the Knauf Gips factory in Soledar is ongoing (5). Ukrainian counter attacks in the factory have not been able to dislodge the Russian attackers.

"POINT (37.7505835 48.2384507)",12,There is a lot of fighting and heavy artillery bombardments around Donetsk city. 

Russia is attacking Krasnohorivka from the north (12). Russia wants to capture here and Pisky and build pincers to encircle the Avdiivka. So far their assaults on Krasnohorivka have all failed.
"POINT (37.7727011 48.0840918)",13,Russia’s assault directly towards Avdiivka is failing, as everyone expected (13). Russia is still trying to capture Pisky, and they have made little if any progress over the past few days (14).
"POINT (37.7019136 48.0513764)",14,Russia’s assault directly towards Avdiivka is failing, as everyone expected (13). Russia is still trying to capture Pisky, and they have made little if any progress over the past few days (14).
"POINT (37.6660486 48.0027584)",15,Russia is still trying to attack north from Lozove, perhaps to support the attack on Pisky, but without success (15). Similarly, their attack on Marinka has accomplished nothing (16).

"POINT (37.5631568 47.9333426)",16,Russia is still trying to attack north from Lozove, perhaps to support the attack on Pisky, but without success (15). Similarly, their attack on Marinka has accomplished nothing (16).

"POINT (37.1742005 47.7196422)",17,South of Donetsk, Russia assaulted Shevchenko (17). Up until now I thought this town was a gray area, but given that Ukraine managed to repel this attack, perhaps they have more control over the area than I gave credit for. I am keeping the area marked as a gray area, though.
"POINT (35.4701406 47.4522626)",18,In Zaporizhzhia, I see evidence of very heavy Ukrainian shelling of Russian positions (18). Ukrainian shelling of these areas has been going on for some time, and Ukraine’s successful counter battery fire is why they are able to move south from Orikhiv, Shcherbaky, and Kamyanske.

As Ukrainian counter battery fire continues to excel and degrade Russia’s own artillery, Ukraine’s offensive capability will increase and we could see a more robust thrust south. Although I doubt we will see a large offensive.

Having said that, taking Tokmak is a significant priority for Ukraine. Their closest forces (not counting special forces or recon) are 24km north of Tokmak at the moment.
