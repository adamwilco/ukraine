"POINT (36.8130029 49.4128607)",3,Yesterday, southwest of Kharkiv, Russia also assaulted Husarivka (3), which similarly failed.
"POINT (37.0687715 49.1062965)",4,Civilians north of Izyum claim they hear fighting getting closer and closer to their town, which they find exciting as they long to be liberated. Ukraine may have captured Sulyhivka and Dovhenke, but I will not update my map without proof. Yesterday, Russia attacked Velyka Komyshuvakha (4), but the attack failed.
"POINT (38.245814 48.9259598)",5,In the Siversk area, Russia has restarted its offensive Siversk, although most of their forces have shifted south towards Bakhmut, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Russian attacks on Hryhorivka (5) have all failed. Russia managed to gain a foothold on the outskirts of Verkhnokamyanske for the first time, but their assaults on the town failed (6). Yesterday, Russia attacked Spirne (7), and today they attacked Ivano-Darivka (8). I have not seen evidence of success in either location.

"POINT (38.1837919 48.6747204)",9,In the Bakhmut area, Russia is continuously assaulting Yakovlivka (9), Soledar (10), and Bakhmutske (11). They have no tangible success in Yakovlivka or Bakhmutske. In Soledar, I had Ukrainian confirmation that Russia had captured several buildings and streets, but that source was wrong, and I have corrected my map.

"POINT (38.0895329 48.6105094)",12,In Bakhmut (12), Russian propaganda has been claiming all sorts of victories and captures, but the reality is that Russia has not made progress in several days. They appear to have demolished a Ukrainian position near the front line today, though, and the explosion was quite large.
"POINT (38.1178435 48.5516922)",13,South of Bakhmut, Russia is still assaulting Vesela Dolyna (13), Zaitseve (14), and Vershyna (15). I have seen multiple confirmations of Russia capturing Vershyna, only to see the status return to 'contested.' Russia has progressed to the outskirts of Zaitseve, where they heroically captured a storm drain and then posted hundreds of videos about it on telegram. I assume the fighting in Vesela Dolyna is still around the power substation.

"POINT (38.1511458 48.4592265)",16,Even further south of Bakhmut, there is heavy ongoing fighting near Kodema (16), and for the past two days, Russia has been assaulting Dacha (17). The attacks on Dacha surprised some people who didn't know Russia had captured Hladosove nearly a week ago.

"POINT (37.7427584 48.24335)",18,In the Donetsk area, there is ongoing fighting in Krasnohorivka (18) and Avdiivka (19,20) without much change. Before I move on, I want to point out that last night a large ammonia storage tank exploded in Donetsk (28). Presumably as a result of Ukrainian artillery fire. This explosion caused a significant hazard for the city.

"POINT (37.6964399 48.0493987)",21,In Pisky (21), Russia resorted to firing TOS-1 thermobaric weapons into the town to destroy Ukrainian positions. TOS-1 is a short-range multiple rocket launch system that fires thermobaric weapons designed to destroy buildings and fortifications. These weapons are vulnerable to counter-battery fire due to their short range. Beyond Pisky, Ukraine is preparing its defensive positions in Pervomaiske and Vodyane. These positions are many years old and well developed at this point.
"POINT (37.5620079 47.9260237)",22,Russia also assaulted Marinka without notable success (22).
"POINT (37.2516174 47.7206699)",23,South of Donetsk, Russia attacked Pavlivka but was repelled (23). There were some rumors of Ukraine mounting an attack south from Mykilske, but I could not find any verifiable information on that attack.

"POINT (33.3775826 46.7907773)",25,Tonight, Ukraine fired rockets, presumably HIMARS, into Vesele and Nova Kakhovka (25). They probably target an ammo depot in Vesele and the bridge across the hydroelectric dam in Nova Kakhovka.
