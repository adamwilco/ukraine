"POINT (37.4504945 49.0715455)",D,The news here is perplexing. Yesterday, there was news that Ukraine destroyed a Russian recon unit in Pasika (D). There are also rumors that Ukraine captured Pasika. There is news that Russia removed a pontoon bridge that was just north of Pasika, packed it on a truck and drove away. There are reports that towns north of Izyum are having Russians withdraw, or at least the vast majority of them are withdrawing leaving small numbers behind as retainers. I am drawing this area of my map very conservatively with no changes, but I think in the coming few days or maybe the next week we could see dramatic shifts in these lines. This could be the sort of withdrawal we saw in Kharkiv, where Russia did not completely abandon everything, but they gave up the majority of the ground.

"POINT (37.8146448 48.109307)",16,Russia is launching a large attack from Donetsk in an attempt to break through the Ukrainian line and push them back to their second line of defense. This attack is occuring on concert with their attacks on Bakhmut and Siversk which both serve the same purpose. They are supporting this attack with large artillery barrages. Thus far, their attacks on Avdiivka have accomplished literally nothing (16). They have not captured a single meter of land.

Violating the customs of war and for the purpose of misleading, the Russian invaders used the field uniform of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with white bandages on their arms and legs during the assault in the area of Pisky settlement.
