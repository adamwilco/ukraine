My daily update! I want to state up front that I have no idea what is going on in Kherson, and I spent all day trying to understand Kharkiv. And I probably still don't understand Kharkiv. #ukrdailyupdate

First, the Kharkiv area: I am confused. Let me explain. In the past, I have heard that Ukraine sent a recon unit up through Izbytske, but that they did not control the area. Today, there is a report that Russia sent forces to Izbytske from the direction of Ternova, ig from the west, and that their assault on the town failed but they established control over the northern outskirts. Which I have depicted on the map. So, perhaps this means Ukraine had sent more than just a recon unit into this area? Or perhaps the recon people are the ones who fought off the Russians, I am not sure. From what I understand, Ternova and Rubizhne are both kinda-sorta under Russian control, but are treated as a sort of no-man's land. I have marked these areas purple as a result. Today, I saw reports of Russia pushing south from Rubizhne, mostly from Russian sources, and I spent *hours* trying to figure out of this is true or not. From the information I can gather, the calims are false and Ukraine controls all the areas south of Rubizhne along with Bairak.
