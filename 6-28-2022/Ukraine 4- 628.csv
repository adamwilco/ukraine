"POINT (37.0794764 49.3849507)",2,Russia assaulted Zalyman from Dovhalivka for the second day in a row (2). Here is closer look at this river crossing, it is a pretty good place to attempt a river crossing. There are forested areas on the Russian side with wide open areas on the Ukrainian side, which gives the attacker an advantage. The defender has less cover to hide behind.

Anyway, the Russian attempt to cross the river failed and Ukraine still controls the town.

"POINT (38.2302132 48.9943232)",5,There are pretty strong hints that Russia crossed the Siverskyi Donets river somewhere around Pryvilla (5). I don't know if they would come from the west, north, or north east.

It is not confirmed that this crossing happened or was successful, but there are rumors that Russian forces are already inside of the town of Pryvilla. Take those rumors with a grain of salt.
