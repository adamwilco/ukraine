"POINT (37.6932473 48.0507183)",15,In Pisky, Russian artillery poured tens of thousands of shells over the past few days, and the defenses have been pulverized and destroyed. This afternoon Russia claimed to have captured roughly two thirds of the town (15). Ukraine suffered high casualty rates in this town as well.
"POINT (37.5417857 47.942754)",16,In Marinka, just south, of Pisky, Russia is raining in a lot of artillery as well, but the assault has not been successful (16).

"POINT (36.679585 47.7937852)",17,In the Hulyaipole/Velyka Novosilka area, Russia performed reconnaissance around Novopil (17) and shelled Novodarivka.
"POINT (36.2670712 47.6101313)",18,In the Zaporizhzhia front, Ukraine is performing a slow and steady attack south towards Dorozhnyanka (18), Nesterianka (19), and Konovalova (20). All Russian attempts to stop these advances have failed.

"POINT (33.7196641 47.3910444)",21,Russia attack Trudoliubivka and were repelled (21). 
"POINT (37.4648092 49.0510845)",A,The lack of news from Bohorodychne has pushed me to extend the uncertain area even further north (A) towards Pasika. It is possible that Ukraine controls this entire gray area, perhaps even Pasika. 

"POINT (38.2574744 48.8585067)",B,In the Siversk area is a continued artillery duel. Today, Russia heavily shelled the Verkhnokamyanka town (B), which is rather small and just west of the Verkhnokamyanka oil refinery which is more obviously labeled on the map. This small town is one of the two remaining strongholds Ukraine holds in the Luhansk Oblast,the other being their remaining foothold in the Bilhorivka (C ) area just north. I have decided to mark these areas as contested rather than in Ukrainian control, but they certainly are not in Russian control.
